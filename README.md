### Winter 2024-2025 lunar project
Contains scripts and related work for binning spectra

### TODO (in order of priority)
- convert to python script file to run from cli
- modify to read in a folder of csvs and a target to bin to (m3 in original case)
- use variable (0.02 vs 0.04) step size based on micron range
- rename + recolor graph legend
- save graphs into subfolders based on lunar_analog_spectra folders (Iceland_JB501C graph goes into /Glass_volcanics)
- prompt user whether to save graphs
