### M3 lunar project
Contains scripts and related work for converting lab spectra to targeted and global wavelength formats.

### TODO
- micron symbol not saving to filename, retain original filename
- split general:targeted, targeted:global into separate script files
- import script files, run in on general .py file
- switch assumptions to selecting wavelength column manually
- fast track processing with preferred format

- update .py script loading, then match code loops
- match pathing methods for targeted:global
- column naming (wl, x, wl targeted, x targeted, wl global, x global)
- unified .py script for targeted:global
- unify precision/truncation format
- update instructions on .py scripts
- tutorial video for .py scripts
